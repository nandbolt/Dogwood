A very small text-based adventure written in python for my Intro to Programming class at UT Austin (Fall 2022). I put it on trinket if you wanna run it on the brower: https://trinket.io/python3/54dca10c0f06

The code is nothing special, but the story is somewhat entertaining, with 9 different endings!
