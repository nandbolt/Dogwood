A very small text-based adventure written in python for my Intro to Programming class at UT Austin (Fall 2022). I put it on trinket here if you'd prefer just running it on the browser: https://trinket.io/python/f4fd39ba7058

The code is nothing special, but the story is somewhat entertaining, with 9 different endings!
